This project utilizes the Early Biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease dataset, which captures naturally connected speech, as a diagnostic tool for Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkinson's is a progressive neurological disorder affecting the nervous system, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. The dataset includes participants with PD, those at risk of developing PD, and healthy controls. This study employs machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict PD based on features extracted from speech data. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, feature analysis, and model evaluation. Results show that Logistic Regression, despite not being an ideal model, maintains competitive performance. This analysis emphasizes the importance of incorporating diverse speech features for comprehensive PD diagnosis.
